This is a simple plugin for vim that allows one to upload blogposts to [write.as](https://write.as/) from the VIM Buffer.

# Installation

The easiest way to install this plugin is, obviously, by a package manager like [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
